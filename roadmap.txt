The way to access the api is via this string:
https://steamcommunity.com/market/priceoverview/?%20country=IT&currency=3&appid=730&market_hash_name={AK-47}%20%7C%20{Redline}%20%28{Field-Tested}%29


this time there is no need for furhter credentials

where each parenthesis is:
    + name
    + color
    + exterior (e.g. factory new)

this means that the original table to be queires must have
- id
- fullname
- name
- color
- exterior
- collection (?)
- price originally paid for it
- active/inactive (y/n)


the results table that is going to be written at every interaction must have
- progressive
- timestamp of the query
- volume of transaction
- lowest price
- median price

based on these informations i could write a couple of views that show me relevant information and once the database is big enough i could run some statistics and graphs over it by linking it with python
